# AgentX  
*Automate workflows. Effortlessly.*

AgentX is a natural-language-driven workflow generation tool designed to simplify and accelerate how users build flows on the ServiceNow platform. Instead of navigating complex tables, triggers, and configurations, users describe their goal in plain English—and AgentX generates a fully structured, deployable workflow in minutes.

## Overview

Building workflows can be time-consuming and error-prone. Even experienced users struggle with schema complexity, internal dependencies, and manual configuration steps. One mistake often means starting over.

AgentX removes this friction by translating user intent directly into a working flow—no scripting knowledge, no schema expertise, and no manual rework required.

## Key Features

- **Plain-English Input**  
  Users simply describe what they want the workflow to achieve. AgentX interprets the request and structures the flow accordingly.   

- **Instant Flow Generation**  
  Produces a fully deployable workflow within minutes—dramatically reducing setup time.

- **Schema-Aware Intelligence**  
  Automatically understands and exposes relevant context from the ServiceNow schema, removing the need for users to navigate complex tables or dependencies.   

- **Smart Fallback & Auto-Repair**  
  Detects issues and attempts self-correction, minimizing interruptions and debugging effort.  

- **No Scripts Required**  
  Users can build advanced workflows without writing server-side scripts or learning internal configuration details.

## How It Works

1. **User Input** – The user enters a workflow goal in natural language.  
2. **Input Parsing** – AgentX interprets intent and extracts required actions.  
3. **Schema Sharing** – Relevant schema context is surfaced to inform workflow creation.  
4. **Workflow Generation** – Server-side scripting automatically builds the flow behind the scenes.  
5. **Feedback & Approval** – Users review, adjust, and approve the generated workflow.
